[NEWLINE]Welcome. I have something to say, if you care to read?
[NEWLINE]Hey everyone. Welcome. I have something to say, if you care to read?

[NEWLINE]I am recruiting for our Discord Server that's all about Civilization VI.
[NEWLINE]It is mandatory to join, because that connects us outside the game.
[NEWLINE]What this means is that if anyone drops from game, we get them back in.

[NEWLINE]Interested in joining our Discord Server, so we can avoid scrapping game?
[NEWLINE]In case anyone drops. We are able to continue the game with out AI.
[NEWLINE]Rather than lose the progress of the game, and start a new one.

[NEWLINE]I have a discord available to join.
[NEWLINE]The point of joining is to keep players connected outside of the game.

[NEWLINE]I do want you guys to know something first before we start.
[NEWLINE]I will be playing, that is for ceratin, but if you read the title.
