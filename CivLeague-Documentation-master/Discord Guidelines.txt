**__Joining the Civilization :civIcon: League Community__**
  *We value competitiveness, fairness, positive attitudes, with attention to teaching here. Cooperation is key, and would :heart: to play with players who want to be in a long-term invested community. Expect playing with players who encourage other players to not quit, as that is something we'd like to stray from. It creates an imbalance in the game, and can easily shift the winners which determines a different outcome. AI are geneerally aweful at the game, and are easily manipulated. Recieve a great deal of joy knowing your games will go on the record, wins/losses will help you determine how well you are doing in the league's standings. As well as learning what needs improving in your skills to be even better. We hope to share these qualities with each and every member of our community, as you will experience a better gaming format for Civilization :civIcon:*
  *If there are any questions or main concerns regarding some goal achieving greatness, I am open to suggestions (Just click my name, and shoot me a DM @© • Song Adieu#6276 depending the logic that can be discussed when providing feedback for to a better community.*

@Member
•|• **__In-Game Guidelines__** •|•
*To experience a better gaming environment, each player is requested to have:
  •**Mature Level of Understanding**
    *Civilization is a long game, and you'll play many. Making friends is a better way to play.
    When there is war, it's always a better game, to just have fun, even on the losing side.*
  •**Respect**
    *Have respect for players even if they are on the offensive of a situation.
    If on the defensive and lose, just say well played, good job! No need to rage and be upset.
    There is always another game* <3
  •**Honesty**
    *When dealing with League EXP as well as playing honestly.
    We would expect all players to just play to their best abilities and understanding of the game.*
  •**Cooperation**
    *In situations where a player has abused any bans or just simply rehosting a game.
    It just takes some cooperation and maturity to get the game back to how it should be played.
    Reloading is a simple task and every player should have the most recent saves.
    This can be modified in the Game Options.*
***With these qualities, I guarantee each player will have the best Game ever Played.
Regardless of the end result. You will learn at a better rate as well.
Following these Game Guidelines will ensure Competiveness on another level.***

@Member
  | **__Trading__** |
    •**No City Trading**
      *It's a feature, that can be abused. Especially in Teamers.
      You may trade back a city after it was once captured if it settle's a peace agreement.*
    •**No GPT Trading**
      *This is an exploit, that can be abused. The Gold never negates.
      Teamers/FFA games may trade actual Gold, to help keep player(s) above 0.

@Member
  | **__Setting Pins__** |
    •**During War**
      *Do not place pins on enemy units with their attention to it.
      It can be problematic when they try to select their units, and prevent them from fast clicking.
      This is not a strategy, it is poor sportsman, and that is not what this community is about.*
    •**Others**
      *Please do not set pings publically for everyone to see, as it can cause a crash if set far away.*

@Member
  | **__Handling a Disconnected Player__** |
  *If a player has dropped from the game, please allow a ten minute break to see if they rejoin.*
    •**Returning Player within 10 Minutes**
      *At least until there is a Pitboss option, I do recommend players just do a reload from a save.
      AI can be quite a pain, and may tweak the game by giving buffs, or changing policies, gold.*
    •**Non-Returning Player**
      *Continue the game after the ten minutes have been achieved or Vote to scrap the game.
      The reason a vote to scrap may be recommended, is because the AI are manipulated quite easily.
      So if anyone feels that the game will become unfair, a vote may always take place. Unanimously.*

@Member
  | **__Handling a Reload__** |
*For a few reasons, reloading the game is required.
Whoever host's games frequently, should set their saves to every turn for the past 10 turns.
Loading from an autosave is quite simple, just by following these steps:
  **Multiplayer** > **Online** > **Load Game** > **Autosaves Check Box**
Load the most recent save.*

@Member
•|• **__Quitter Role__**
*Role applied to players who quit their previous game, unexpectedly without Communicating.
Also can be applied when a player who has quit against the guidelines set in place.
To help maintain a better playing environment, we ask that players not quit the game, unelss allowed.*
  @Quitter
  •**Removing the Role**
    *To remove the role, just simply complete one game, and have that game submitted to the records.*

@Member
•|• **__Ways to Leave the Game__** •|•
*For any reason you feel that you want to leave the game, there are available options to leave.
This is to prevent a game being messed up by AI. Usually when AI take over, they aren't beneficial.
They can easily be steam rolled by their nearest neighbor, changing the outcome of the game.
The longer you stay in the game, the more potential you have to learning the game, rather than quit.*
  | **__Losing 66% of Cities__** |
    *If you have lost 66% of your total cities at one point. Also, if you have hardly any military to defend with.
    As there is no way of defending, and just puts you in an irrelevant situation. You may bow out of the game.*
  | **__Lost Capital__** |
    *If you have lost your Capital and have no military to defend with. You may bow out of the game.*
  | **__Irrelevancy Vote__** |
    *If there is no way you impact the game, and players feel the same.
    Then a vote is taken place on how irrelevant you are in the game.
    This can take place after turn 85, and the vote has to be unanimously agreed upon.*
  | **__Real Life Issues__** |
    *If you have to leave the game for any reasons pertaining to real life, then that is fine.
    All that is asked of you is that you talk to the players before leaving the game.
    Afterall you joined this community to get away from players who quit a game because of the progress.*
      ***If this seems to happen frequently, you may be monitored.***

@Member
•|• **__No Diplomacy__** •|•
*Each Player in the Current Staging Lobby has to **Agree (+)** to these options before playing.
As this method of playing is for skilled players, where cooperative mature players should enjoy.*
  | **__Trading__** |
    •**No Trading**
      *The only trade allowed is a Peace Negotiation that can require the return of a city.*
  | **__Trader Routes__** |
    •**Sending to Civillizations**
      *May not send any trader routes to any other Civilization.
      May only send trader routes to City States or to Cities in your Empire.
      Sending them to Teamers Allies is also Allowed.*
  | **__Communication__** |
    •**Voice|Game Chat**
      *Everything you ask someone Private, it needs to be stated public, if pertaining to the game.
      This goes for Peace Negotiations between the two players. State what was traded, if else.
      After Declaring War, this has to be stated Publically to all the Players.*
    •**No Collusion**
      *When playing **No Diplomacy**, the method is intended only to help one learn the game better.
      As you won't be relying on any assistance from any other player that can provide help.
      So there __may not__ be requests or whispers made about assistance from another close civilization.
      Please understand again that this is for Respective Players who understand the Courtesy for other Players.*

**__Server Update__**
*Going to be getting to update with a new Connection Deal. Try to eliminate another Program.
So the point is to eventually get rid of the Steam Group. As we will not need to be using it.
There is a way to join games on players who just add their steam profile to their Discord Profile.
So whoever says they are hosting, can just view their discord profile, and view the profile, to join Game.
It's quite simple, and that's why I took the time to make an instruction guide.
Keep in mind, that if your profile is set to private, then you may not be able to host, until that is fixed.
You can learn how to use the .setSteam command and more in the #help channel, or by writing that command.
You may also see a preview right here. Please Vote :agree: | :disagree: to let me know how you feel about this.*

  *:agree: if you wish to see this in the guidelines as a potential abuse.

•|• **__Last Moving/First Moving (Concerns)__** •|•
  *This game is known for the offset on turns, allowing some people to get first move, before they can even start.
  These are a list of options to base your judgement and votes off of.*
    | **__First Moving__**  |
      •At times, the game disallows certain people to act as fast as other players, even though they may spam the clicks.
      •This is all random, and sometimes is based by a better pc/connection. Still theoretical.
    | **__Last Moving__** |
      •Could be strategic, but also abusive.
      •Most players avoid trying to attack first if they know they won't get the turn off.
      •Keep in mind that other players may want to worry about city building things before the warring aspect.
